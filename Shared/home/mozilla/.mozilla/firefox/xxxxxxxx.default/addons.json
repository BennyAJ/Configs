It has been specially designed for Windows 7 (with Aero Style enabled), but it can also be installed on other Windows versions and Linux (just be aware that some things may look different due to differences between platforms). It does NOT officially support Aurora/Firefox Developer Edition, Nightly and any Firefox forked versions (such as Palemoon, Cyberfox, Waterfox, etc.). It is not officially available for MAC, because I can't offer support for this platform in case of issues.\nIt contains no added functionalities, it's simply a full Firefox's GUI aesthetic customization.\n\n• Userstyles to customize a bit more your FT Deepdark (such as : dark \"about:home\", \"aero style\" for tabs and tab bar background, translucent scrollbars, darker url bar background, ...) are available at userstyles.org\n• IMPORTANT ! To use these \"userstyles\" you need first to install an add-on called \"Stylish\"\n\n• FT DEEPDARK 14.1.1 available on the FT DeepDark's \"version history\" page\n\n• WHAT TO DO WHEN FACING AN ISSUE WITH FT DEEPDARK ?\n\n1) before reporting it, first try to see if the issue is due to the theme itself. How ? Enable the default theme and check if the issue is still there. If not, enable again the FT theme, but disable all other installed addons to check if the issue can be due to a conflict between addons.\n\n2) If the issue is still there after disabling all other addons and if the default theme doesn t have that issue, try to download and install again the theme (check also if you have the latest version installed, maybe the bug you want to report has already been solved with the latest updates).\n\n3) if after trying what mentioned above the problem is linked with the use of the FT theme, please, send me an e-mail (there is a link on the add-ons page to contact me) instead of reporting the bug in the add-on's review section. When sending an e-mail to report a bug, do not forget to tell me which operating system (Windows XP, 7, Vista, Linux, etc.) you are running on your computer, which version of Firefox and FT theme you are using and if you have any operating system custom theme (it can also be a cause of the issue). Then, describe the most precisely you can the issue you are facing and, if possible, please, join a screenshot and/or a short video so I could see exactly how it looks (English is not my mother tongue as you can easily notice, so a picture can avoid the language problems). All that will help me to understand better what is the problem and to solve it quicker if possible.\nI can t promise you that I ll manage to fix every problems and also in short time, but I ll do my best for it. I m working on my themes during my free time so it can take a bit time before fixing the issues (you need also to be conscious that any updates need to be checked by Mozilla first, but if you want to have the updates a bit quicker you can follow me on Twitter and know immediately when a new version is available for download).","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":"Free for non-commercial personal use.

Everything can be disabled.\n    Easy for beginners, powerful for advanced users. Not just for Vim fanatics.\n    Modeled after Vimium for Chrome.\n\nNew to VimFx? Check out Questions & Answers!\nPower user? Make a config file!\nIn either case, have look at the the documentation and the wiki.\n\nVimFx is made by these awesome people.\n\nWhy VimFx was created\n\n    Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion, Vimperator has too many features and aggressively changes the default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium is exactly what I need in terms of added functionality, but for Chrome. That’s why I decided to develop similar extension for Firefox.\n\n     VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.\n\n    – Anton Khodakivskiy, VimFx’s original author.\n\n\nKey Features\nVimFx has concise shortcuts for most commonly performed actions. Many simply invoke native Firefox features. That is preferred over re-implementing similar functionality.\n\nFollow links, focus text inputs and click buttons using hint markers by pressing f. This command has many variations, for example to copy links or open them in new tabs.\n\nSearch with / and cycle between matches with n and N.\n\nOpen a new tab with t, close it with x. Reopen it again with X. Switch between tabs with J and K, or some of the several other tab commands.\n\nScrolling left/down/up/right: h, j, k, l.\nTop/Bottom: gg, G.\nPage up/down: space, shift-space.\nHalf a page: d, u.\n\nThere are of course many more shortcuts! Press ? to see them all, and then / to search among them. Click on a command or open VimFx’s settings page in the Add-ons Manager to customize the default shortcuts.\n\nYou can temporarily disable VimFx by using Ignore mode. Press i to enter it, and shift-escape to exit. Use the blacklist to automatically enter Ignore mode on specific sites.\n\nThere’s also an article on ghacks.net which is a good introduction.\n\nFeedback\nEnjoying VimFx?
